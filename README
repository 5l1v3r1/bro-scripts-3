The `sidejack.bro
<http://git.bro-ids.org/bro-scripts.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/sidejack.bro>`_
script detects the reuse of session cookies in different contexts.
Sidejacking_ is also known as cookie hijacking and means that an
attacker captured a session cookie of a victim to reuse that session.
Off-the-shelf tools like Firesheep_ implement this attack as a Firefox
extension, which makes this attack accessible to the masses.

In its default settings, the script raises a SessionCookiReuse notice when the
same session cookie is seen from different user agents. If in addition the IP
addresses do not match, a Sidejack notice is being triggered.

There exist various options to tweak the behavior of the script. First, the
notion of a user can be changed. In flat IP address space, it makes sense to
identify a user by its IP address, but this would fail in a NAT environment
where a single IP accomodates several users. For NAT scenarios, one could
define a user as a pair of IP address and User-Agent header. For large NATs or
NATs with identically configured machines, this latter notion of user could be
prone to false positivies. The user can change the definition of a user via

::

    redef HTTP::user_is_ip = F;

Another issue poses the presence of absence of DHCP context. Consider a hotspot
or coffeeshop network operator with a private IP space. If Bro can see DHCP
traffic, we can crisply identify a user by its MAC address and do not have to
resort to high-level notions, such as provided by HTTP headers. In a static
setup, however, this context will likely not be available. At the same time, if
a different address reuses a session cookie in a static IP topology, we
probably observed a sidejacking attack. Furthermore, if the same address uses
the same sesssion cookie from a different user agent, we report such activity.
By setting

::

    redef HTTP::use_dhcp_aliases = T;
    
one tells Bro to use the DHCP analyzer to keep track of multiple IP addresses
for the same host. It makes only sense to set this flag when Bro actually sees
DHCP traffic.

There is another subtlety: the cookie header consists of a list of key-value
pairs, yet only a subset of those represent a user session while the others
could be random. Simply comparing the entire cookie string against a value seen
in the past would thus be prone to false negatives. Hence we have to restrict
ourselves to the relevant session-identifying subset. In fact, this is how
Firesheeps works: it ships with site-specific handlers that define the cookie
keys to extract and then sets only those to impersonate a user. This motivates
the following design: if a specification for a particular service is available,
restrict the cookie to the relevant fields, and otherwise use the cookie as a
whole. The default set of known services that ships with the detector is based
on all handlers Firesheep currently implements. To extend the detection to all
cookies, one can set

::

    redef HTTP::known_services_only = F;

Finally, there are timeouts for cookie expiration and DHCP expiration can be
adjusted, e.g.,

::

    redef HTTP::cookie_expiration = 1 day;
    redef HTTP::dhcp_expiration = 7 days;

If a cookie is not seen after the ``cookie_expiration``, the associated state
is removed. Similarly, previous IP addresses of a host that is inactive for
more than the ``dhcp_expiration`` will be expunged. More information about the
script can be found at SidejackingBlogPost_.

Requires Bro 1.5.
